<h2>Your game title</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept!:</strong>
Player must avoid the squares to survive.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to have a sense of escalating intensity, as the screen fills up with enemies over time.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This game would classify as a top-down bullet hell.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player can use the left and right arrow keys to turn the green ship left and right. The up arrow key can be used to accelerate the ship forward.
<br><br>The enemies are spawned on the edge of the screen (randomly) every 4 seconds. If an enemy hits the player's ship, the player loses. The score is displayed in the top left, and it will increase constantly as the player survives the barrage of squares.
<br><br>
In order to restart the game, the player must refresh the page.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Basic top-down ship controls, player survival
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The player has no defense against the enemies, so they must constantly plan out safe paths through the enemies.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game is abstract - the premise is just what it is: it's a game.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Story:</strong>
N/A
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who like old arcade-style games. The style is meant to resemble asteroids.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Game could last anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes depending on how long the player can survive.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The player must constantly be spotting safe spots and paths for the ship to survive. Generally, avoiding the center is a good idea once there are many enemies on screen.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made the art assets in Photoshop, and the sounds via <a href="bfxr.net">bfxr</a>.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I used this Phaser example: <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/arcade-physics/asteroids-movement">Asteroids Movement</a>, and then coded the rest by referencing small things from the main tutorial (velocity, detecing overlapping sprites, etc).
